# Linked-List

Understanding a stack structure is daunting. . That is why I am not going to try to explain it â€¦ but you can read the wiki if you want. What I am going to try and explain is the mystery of the linked list. I say it's a mystery because In preparation for job interviews I have been on sites like code wars and Leet code trying to solve problems. I load a question, think about it, struggle for a while, and finally have an aha moment before getting a solution. But every once in a while I see this.
